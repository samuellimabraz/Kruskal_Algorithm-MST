# Kruskal_Algorithm-MST
This project implements Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in any graph. Furthermore, the project also includes the creation and editing of a video that represents the respective path of MST. The libraries used for this purpose are PIL, moviepy and OpenCV.
